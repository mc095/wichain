## 🚀 How to Create a Release

### Method 1: Push a Tag (Recommended)

```bash
cd f:\Major_Project\wichain

# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release v1.0.1: Multi-platform builds with docs"

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Create and push tag
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

**What happens:**
1. GitHub Actions triggers on tag push
2. Builds for Windows, Linux, macOS in parallel
3. Uploads artifacts
4. Creates GitHub Release automatically
5. Attaches all installers to release
6. Generates release notes

### Method 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Build WiChain for All Platforms"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose branch
5. Run
