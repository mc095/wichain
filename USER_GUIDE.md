## First Time Setup

### 1. Welcome Screen

When you first launch WiChain, you'll see the welcome slideshow explaining key features:
- Peer-to-peer messaging
- Blockchain-backed history
- Cryptographic signatures
- Trust scoring

Click through or skip to continue.

### 2. Create Your Identity

**Choose Your Alias:**
- Enter a username (3-20 characters)
- This is how others see you on the network
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores

**Identity Generation:**
- WiChain automatically creates an Ed25519 keypair
- Your **private key** stays on your device (never shared)
- Your **public key** is broadcast to identify you
- Keys are stored securely in local storage

**Important:** Your identity is tied to this device. If you reinstall or clear data, you'll need to create a new identity.

### 3. Main Interface

After setup, you'll see the main chat interface with three panels:
- **Left Sidebar**: Peers and groups
- **Center Panel**: Chat messages
- **Right Panel** (optional): Advanced features

---

## User Interface Overview

---

## Direct Messaging

### Starting a Conversation

1. **Discover Peers**: Wait for peers to appear in sidebar (usually 1-5 seconds)
2. **Select Peer**: Click on their name/key
3. **Send Message**: Type and press Enter

### Message Flow

```
You type message
    ‚Üì
Message is signed with your private key
    ‚Üì
Message is obfuscated (XOR with SHA3-512)
    ‚Üì
Sent via UDP to peer's IP
    ‚Üì
Peer receives and de-obfuscates
    ‚Üì
Peer verifies your signature
    ‚Üì
Message displayed (if verified)
    ‚Üì
Added to peer's local blockchain
```

### Message States

| Icon | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| ‚úÖ | Verified | Message is authentic |
| ‚ùå | Failed | Signature invalid, possibly tampered |
| ‚è≥ | Pending | Waiting for verification |
| üì§ | Sent | Your message, awaiting delivery |

### Privacy Features

- Messages are **not stored on any central server**
- Only sender and recipient have the message
- Messages are obfuscated on the network
- Your IP is only visible to direct chat partners
- No message history sync (each device is independent)

---

## Group Chats

### Creating a Group

1. Click **"Create Group"** in sidebar
2. Select multiple peers from the list
3. Click **"Create"**
4. Group chat opens automatically

### Group Features

**Group ID:**
- Deterministically generated from member public keys
- Same members = same group ID
- Members are sorted, so order doesn't matter

**Message Delivery:**
- Sent via UDP multicast to all members
- Each member verifies the signature
- All members must be online to receive

**Group Limitations:**
- **Ephemeral**: Groups don't persist after app close
- **No history**: New members don't see old messages
- **Member limit**: Recommended max 10 members (UDP limitations)

### Group Management

- **Leave Group**: Close the group tab
- **View Members**: Check header in chat panel
- **Add Members**: Must create new group with new member set
- **Remove Members**: Create new group without them

---

## Advanced Features

### üì¶ Blockchain View

See your local blockchain history:
- **Block Number**: Sequential index
- **Timestamp**: When block was created
- **Sender**: Who sent the message
- **Message Hash**: SHA3 hash of content
- **Previous Hash**: Link to previous block
- **Block Hash**: Unique identifier

**Blockchain Properties:**
- Append-only (can't delete or modify)
- Cryptographically linked
- Tamper-evident (any change breaks chain)
- Local to your device

### üìä Network Statistics

Monitor network activity:
- **Peers Discovered**: Total peers found
- **Messages Sent**: Your outgoing message count
- **Messages Received**: Incoming message count
- **Broadcast Count**: Discovery beacon transmissions
- **Network Uptime**: How long you've been online

### üéØ Trust Scoring System

**How Trust Works:**
- Each peer starts at 50 trust
- **+1** for each valid message received
- **-5** for signature verification failure
- **-0.1** per minute of inactivity (decay)
- Capped at 0 (min) and 100 (max)

**Trust Indicators:**
- **80-100**: Highly trusted (frequent, valid interaction)
- **50-79**: Normal trust (moderate interaction)
- **20-49**: Low trust (inactive or few messages)
- **0-19**: Very low trust (verification failures or very inactive)

**Use Cases:**
- Identify reliable peers
- Detect potential tampering
- Prioritize responses from trusted peers

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

Configure WiChain:
- **Theme**: Light/Dark mode
- **Notifications**: Enable/disable sound alerts
- **Auto-discover**: Toggle peer discovery
- **Port Configuration**: Change UDP ports (advanced)
- **Clear Data**: Reset identity and blockchain

## Understanding Security

### üîê Cryptographic Signing

**What it does:**
- Proves message authenticity
- Prevents impersonation
- Ensures message integrity

**How it works:**
1. You sign message with your private key
2. Signature is attached to message
3. Recipient verifies using your public key
4. Only valid signatures are accepted

**Verification failure means:**
- Message was tampered with, OR
- Sender's identity changed, OR
- Network interference

### üîí Message Obfuscation

**What it does:**
- Hides message content on network
- Prevents casual snooping
- Basic confidentiality layer

**What it's NOT:**
- Not full encryption
- Not secure against determined attackers
- Not a replacement for VPN/TLS

**How it works:**
- SHA3-512 hash of shared data
- XOR with message bytes
- Reversible by recipient

### ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain Integrity

**Purpose:**
- Tamper-evident history
- Proves message timeline
- Detects unauthorized changes

**Properties:**
- Each block links to previous (hash chain)
- Changing one block breaks all subsequent blocks
- Can verify entire chain integrity
- No consensus needed (local only)

**NOT a distributed blockchain:**
- Each device has its own chain
- No mining or proof-of-work
- No synchronization between peers
- Used for local integrity only

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

1. **Keep your private key secure**
   - Don't share identity files
   - Don't copy to untrusted devices
   - Backup securely if needed

2. **Verify trust scores**
   - Check peer trust before sharing sensitive info
   - Low trust = possible issues

3. **Watch for verification failures**
   - Repeated failures = possible attack
   - Contact peer via alternate channel

4. **Use on trusted LANs only**
   - Not suitable for public WiFi
   - Best on home/office networks
   - Consider VPN for added security

5. **Don't rely on obfuscation for secrets**
   - Use additional encryption for sensitive data
   - Consider end-to-end encrypted alternatives for confidential comms

## FAQ

### General

**Q: Is WiChain free?**  
A: Yes, completely free and open source.

**Q: Do I need internet?**  
A: No, only a local network (LAN). Internet not required.

**Q: Can I use WiChain on public WiFi?**  
A: Not recommended. Use on trusted private networks only.

**Q: How many people can use WiChain simultaneously?**  
A: Theoretically unlimited, but groups are best kept under 10 members.

### Setup

**Q: Why can't I see any peers?**  
A: Check that:
- You're on the same LAN
- Firewall isn't blocking UDP
- Network allows broadcast/multicast
- Other peers are running WiChain

**Q: Can I change my alias later?**  
A: Yes, in Settings ‚Üí Identity ‚Üí Change Alias

**Q: I lost my identity. Can I recover it?**  
A: No, identities are device-specific. You'll need to create a new one.

### Messaging

**Q: Are messages saved?**  
A: Yes, in your local blockchain. But they don't sync between devices.

**Q: Can I delete sent messages?**  
A: No, blockchain is append-only. Messages are permanent on your device.

**Q: What happens if I'm offline?**  
A: You won't receive messages. They're not queued or stored.

**Q: Can I message someone not on my LAN?**  
A: No, WiChain is designed for LAN only. Consider VPN to extend your LAN.

### Security

**Q: Are my messages encrypted?**  
A: They're obfuscated (XOR), not fully encrypted. Not secure against determined attackers.

**Q: Can someone impersonate me?**  
A: No, as long as your private key is secure. Messages are cryptographically signed.

**Q: What if someone intercepts my messages?**  
A: They'd see obfuscated data. With effort, they could decode it. Use VPN/TLS for sensitive data.

**Q: Is my IP address visible?**  
A: Yes, to anyone on your LAN. WiChain uses UDP with your actual IP.

### Technical

**Q: What ports does WiChain use?**  
A: Default UDP ports (configurable in Settings). Check your firewall.

**Q: Can I run WiChain on a server?**  
A: Yes, but it's designed as a desktop app. Headless mode not officially supported.

**Q: Does WiChain work on mobile?**  
A: Not currently. Desktop only (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Q: Can I build from source?**  
A: Yes! See [Build Guide](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for instructions.
